Deploying an End to End solution with a Windows virtual Machine on AWS
Understand the scenario
In this project, you will deploy an End-to-End Solution in AWS. First, you will create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment for the EC2 instances. Next, you will create an Amazon S3 bucket that will hold the static web content for the website, and then you will create a custom EC2 launch template that includes the web server engine and an initial homepage for the website. Finally, you will deploy a web server based on the custom launch template, and then you will verify that the website is publicly available from the new EC2 instance.
